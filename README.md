### Welcome to libcppweb!

## The What
libcppweb is a lightweight, easy-to-use C++ web server library that allows developers to create web applications quickly and easily. It's designed to be simple and intuitive, with a focus on ease of use and performance.

## The Why
Honestly, there isn't much of a why behind this library. It was created as a meme in a Discord server, as new web developers joined and asked if they could create a web server in C++. This library was born out of that meme, and it's becoming something more than just a meme.

## Reference Guide
Our current Reference Guide is available [here](REFERENCE.md). This includes our current syntax in our `main` branch. 

For now, we only have the `main` branch. After a stable release, we'll add a branch for code in `testing` and `unstable` status.

## Contributing
See something we don't yet have added but you want? Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request on our [repository](https://github.com/co3ndev/libcppweb/Issues).

## Special thanks
Special thanks to the inexperienced developers asking for a web server library in C++. Without their curiosity, this library would not exist.
