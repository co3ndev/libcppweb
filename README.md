### Welcome to libcppweb!

## The What
libcppweb is a lightweight, easy-to-use C++ web server library that allows developers to create web applications quickly and easily. It's designed to be simple and intuitive, with a focus on ease of use and performance.

## The Why
Honestly, there isn't much of a why behind this library. It was created as a meme in a Discord server, as new web developers joined and asked if they could create a web server in C++. This library was born out of that meme, and it's becoming something more than just a meme.

## Usage
While our feature set is not huge now, it's growing rapidly. We're constantly adding new features and improving existing ones to make it easier for developers to create web applications. The most up-to-date feature list is in the code.

## Contributing
See something we don't yet have added but you want? Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/co3ndev/libcppweb).

## Special thanks
Special thanks to the inexperienced developers asking for a web server library in C++. Without their curiosity, this library would not exist.
